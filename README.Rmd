W.E.B Du Bois (February 23, 1868 â€“ August 27, 1963) was an American  sociologist, socialist, historian and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist. Born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community, and after completing graduate work at the University of Berlin and Harvard, where he was the first African American to earn a doctorate, he became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University. Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 (*Source: Wikpedia*).

The development inspiration came from the #DuBoisChallenge2022 and the dissemination of SER (International Seminar on Statistics with R).
